## Databel Customer Churn Analysis

### Overview

**Project description:** This is an Excel project that investigates a dataset from a telecommunications company Databel and analyzes their churn rates. Churn is a significant business metric that is relevant for various industries, including the telecommunications sector which operates with a subscription-based model. Managing customer relations and minimizing churn is an ongoing process for businesses. In this project, churn is analyzed to figure out:

- What is the overall churn rate?
- Why are customers churning?
- Which customers are churning?
- How to reduce churn?

I've tried to account for these problem statements by creating calculated columns and fields, building PivotTables, and creating a dashboard to communicate insights.

### 1. About dataset

The dataset used for this project is a fictitious dataset taken from DataCamp.

- A single table consisting of 29 columns
- One row per customer
- Snapshot of the database at a specific moment in time (i.e. there's no time dimension)

Columns contain information regarding demographics (age, gender), international plan details (plan, activity status, calls, minutes used, extra charges), data usage details (unlimited data plan, average monthly download, extra charges), and other details (account length, contract type, payment method). These details provide useful metrics while analyzing churn from various perspectives. 

### 2. Data preparation

The initial step included cleaning the dataset to remove duplicates and handle records that contain missing values. Then I proceeded to create a new column named `Churned` and assigned 1 or 0 to each customer based on whether they canceled their subscription or not, which allowed me to easily calculate the churn rate during the analysis stage.

### 3. Exploratory data analysis
I began exploring the dataset by creating a pivot table that displays the total number of customers, number of churners, and a churn rate calculation.

- There are 6687 customers total
- 1796 customers have churned
- Churn rate is 26,86%

**Investigating churn reasons**
As the churn rate at 26,86% is relatively high, the next step is to investigate why this is the case. I've created a pivot table displaying churn reasons and % of churned customers, and a bar chart to visualize them.

The most popular reason for churn results from competition, and customer service shouldn't be overlooked.

This led me to examine competition-related churn more closely:
I've created another pivot filtering by churn reason category and a pie chart.

Results of my initial exploratory analysis naturally raises the question:
> üí≠ Is Databel competitive enough?

But there are still many columns unexplored before attempting to answer this question. Churn patterns can be further analyzed by focusing on demographics, age groups, plan types, and contract types.

**Demographics**
The dataset categorizes individuals by age in three separate columns: Under 30, Senior, and Other. This required me to create a new column to see demographic groups in a single field and add a calculated field to see their churn.

> üö® Senior citizens churn the most.

**Age groups**
I've looked into age dimension more closely to check whether there's a pattern or not. I've used a pivot table grouping ages by bins of 10, then created a clustered column - line chart.

Looks like churn rate gets higher as age group gets older, and older customers have the highest churn rate while being the smallest group.

**Plan types**
I've investigated how plan types influence churn by focusing on limited and unlimited mobile data plans. I had a hypothesis that people who are not on an unlimited data plan would be more likely to churn, but my preliminary exploration revealed the opposite: people on unlimited plan had a churn rate of 32,11% while people who are not had 16,10%.

> üîç Contrary to my hypothesis, unlimited mobile data plan has higher churn.

To examine if this churn is related to the amount of internet usage, I've created a new column named `Data Consumption` using a nested IF statement.

```
=IF([@[Avg Monthly GB Download]] < 5, 
	"Less than 5 GB", 
	IF([@[Avg Monthly GB Download]] >= 10, 
	"10 or more GB", 
	"Between 5 and 10 GB"))
```

> üö® Individuals subscribed to unlimited plan who consume less than 5 GB of monthly mobile data are the most likely to churn.

**International calls**
An initial look at international calls has shown that there is not a drastic difference between international and non-international plans. 

- International plan churn: 24,88%
- Non-international plan churn: 27,07%

I've then looked into this filtering by state, and applied conditional formatting to highlight the states with the highest churn rates. This has revealed that:

> üö® California, Indiana, and New Hampshire are the top three states that have peak international plan churn, with over 60% churn rate.

**Contract type and length**
